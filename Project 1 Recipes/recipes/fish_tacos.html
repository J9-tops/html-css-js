        <h2>Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise </h2>
        <p>“The sauce is yummy,” according to one Allrecipes community member. “We used flounder and sautéed with lime and olive oil. Added avocado to our tacos. Delicious!”</p>
        <p>“Perfect tacos,” raves <a href="">Kristen Andry</a>. “We doubled up the tortillas after warming them one at a time on a cast iron skillet and putting them in the oven to keep warm. Doubling them helps keep everything from falling apart.”</p>
        <p>“This is my go-to fish taco recipe,” says another community member. “I have made it for years and it is one of my husband’s favorites. I use cod. The beer batter is perfect in my opinion and I absolutely love the sauce. I use whatever beer I have on hand and have never had an issue.”</p>
